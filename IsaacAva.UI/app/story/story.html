				<h2>Our story</h2>
				<p>We are ISAAC AVA, an independent fashion brand founded by business duo (and best friends since childhood), Leeds-based fashion designer Victoria Reddington and Dawn Hunter, who heads up the business and operational side of the label.</p>
				<p>Despite being a fledgling brand, ISAAC AVA is already making waves in the industry through our unapologetic ethos of “elevating everyday wear”. The antithesis to fast fashion, we offer designs that are carefully and individually crafted, limited edition, and yet eminently wearable for each and every day.</p>
				<p>“We create innovative designs that are clean, functional and easy to wear. The aim is for each and every piece to <strong>epitomize effortless high fashion</strong>”, says Victoria Reddington.</p>
				<p>The debut collection from ISAAC AVA is 'Blue Lights'. Built around a palette of blue, white, black and grey, the flowing shapes and sweeping lines are directly inspired by J. M. W. Turner’s ‘Rockets and Blue Lights (Close at Hand)’. Evocative of swirling lights thrusting through fog, the designs echo the sea and sky of the Turner painting from which they were inspired.</p>
				<p>Victoria Reddington and Dawn Hunter are the founders of award-winning designer platform <a href="http://www.fashionpony.co.uk" target="_blank">FashionPony.co.uk</a>, which supports and promotes emerging fashion designers. The creation of ISAAC AVA comes four years after honing our craft through the running of the Fashion Pony platform.</p>
				<p><strong>Our aim is to give a personal and efficient service to all our customers, so please don't hesitate to contact us with any queries or bespoke requests for orders.</strong></p>
				<p>We also love to collaborate with other creatives within the fashion industry and will be sharing our fashion editorial work soon. If you are a photographer, stylist, hair/MUA or model and would like to collaborate with us on a project, please <a href="#/contact" target="_blank">get in touch.</a></p>
